## projects

__Risk Parameters Estimation Framework__
- Contributed directly to the risk management and the regulatory compliance of the Canadian Banking business via the modeling, implementation and monitoring of risk parameters.
- Research, development, and deployment of comprehensive account level PD, EAD and LGD parameter models that consider borrower’s credit characteristics, account’s current features, and macro-economic environments. 
- Assisted in evaluating capital requirement and related return measurements of various business strategy and product segments; identify potential weakness and make informed recommendations.

__Predictive analysis of housing affordability in Ontario__
- Coded, validated, tested, implemented and documented statistical models using historical data. Focused on analyzing the features affecting the value of properties in Ontario.
- Improved the model robustness and accuracy (compared to GLM) using ensemble models.
- Collaborated closely with senior consultants to deliver business reports (non-technical). Implemented data visualization using d3.js. 

__Predictive analysis of parking violation behavior in Toronto__	
- Processed 2.8 million parking violation records with Google Map API and transformed datasets into 50+ feature vectors for - machine learning.
- Worked closely with data engineers to import new features from external data sources. 
- Analyzed and predicted parking violation behavior using gradient boosting. Improved the model quality by cross validation and hyper-parameter tuning.
